You need to have docker installed.

open a bash inside the project folder (where the files app, bootstrap, config, database, etc, etc exist).



Type:

#docker ps -a (check that you have Docker installed and running, this is just for checking, its not a necessary step)

#docker compose up -d (starts the app, -d: after the installation is finished the program is running in the background. This stage takes the longest by far!
                       It can take up to 15-20 minutes to complete. Do not move on before it is finished)

#docker compose exec laravelapp bash (enter the laravel bash to execute the migrations and -if you want- seeders)

#cd /var/www/html (Navigate to the Laravel project directory)

#php artisan migrate (Run Laravel migrations)

optional : #php artisan db:seed (If you want to fill up the tables with dummy data)

You can now close the bash, hopefully everything went well. You can make requests locally : http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/..../.../... check out the End-points.txt.

NOTE: If you have seeded just for test and now you want to have fresh empty tables, in the laravelapp bash type #php artisan migrate:refresh

NOTE: You can use the #php artisan db:seed, but for some reason I could get it to fill up the ratings table with unique pairs of "user_id, game_id".
This means that if you do use it, there will be instances where a user has rated more than once for a game (which of course is unacceptable). For testing 
purposes this didn't cause any problems, and I believe that it will not cause any problems to you either. Also the User will not be able to rate more than 
once for a specific game since that case has been covered in the RatingsController.php where we check if a User has already rated a game, and if he did, 
the program simply replaces the old rating and informs the user that "Rating updated successfully".
